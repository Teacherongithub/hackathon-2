 Basic Control, Integration, and Debugging

Learning Goal (User Story 3 & 4): A student/developer will be able to implement basic ROS 2 robot control using provided examples, and understand how to integrate multiple ROS 2 nodes and debug common issues.

4.1 Implementing Basic Robot Control

The most fundamental task in robotics is controlling movement. Once the rclpy fundamentals are understood, the focus shifts to publishing data that affects the robot's physical state.

For simple mobile movement, control is often achieved by publishing a geometry_msgs/Twist message to a designated velocity Topic. This message contains two vectors: linear velocity (how fast and what direction to move) and angular velocity (how fast to rotate).

(ACTION FOR YOU: Insert a simple rclpy publisher code block here that publishes a constant Twist message to make a robot move forward. This directly addresses the goal of implementing basic control.)

4.2 Integrating Multi-Node Systems

A realistic humanoid robot system involves numerous Nodes working together. The successful integration of multiple ROS 2 nodes depends on strict adherence to Topic and Message standards:

    1-Topic Consistency: Every component that needs a piece of data must subscribe to the exact Topic name being published. Misspellings are the most common integration error.
    2-Message Type Agreement: The communicating Nodes must agree on the format of the data. For instance, an image processing Node must publish sensor_msgs/Image, and the computer vision algorithm must be prepared to receive data in that exact format.

Understanding this integration structure allows developers to move toward real-world robot control problems.

4.3 Debugging Common ROS 2 Issues

Debugging is a required skill for any developer, especially when integrating multiple  
ROS 2 nodes. When a system fails, the problem is often related to communication, not necessarily logic. Here are the core command-line tools for diagnosis:
       
       ros2 node list: Use this to verify that all necessary Nodes (sensor drivers, motor controllers, etc.) are actually running. If a Node is missing, the system will break.
       ros2 topic info <topic_name>: Use this to check if a specific Topic is active and confirm that both a Publisher and a Subscriber are correctly connected to it.
       ros2 topic echo <topic_name>: This tool allows you to inspect the data stream in real-time. If the data is flowing but is incorrect (e.g., publishing 0.0 when it should be 1.0), the problem lies in the Node's internal logic.
